A high-performance scientific calculator featuring **MIPS Assembly backend** and **Python Tkinter frontend**, developed as part of Computer Organization and Architecture coursework. This project demonstrates the integration of low-level assembly programming with modern GUI development.

## 🌟 Features

### 🧮 Mathematical Operations
- **Basic Arithmetic**: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division
- **Scientific Functions**: Power (xʸ), Square Root (√), Cube Root (∛), Factorial (x!)
- **Trigonometric**: Sine, Cosine, Tangent (with Degrees/Radians support)
- **Logarithmic**: Base-10 Logarithms
- **Constants**: π (Pi), e (Euler's Number)

### 💻 Technical Architecture
- **Backend**: MIPS Assembly Language (QtSpim compatible)
- **Frontend**: Python Tkinter GUI
- **Performance**: Optimized assembly routines for faster computation
- **Cross-Platform**: Compatible with Windows, Linux, and macOS

### 🎨 User Interface
- Modern, intuitive design with color-coded buttons
- Real-time display with error handling
- Degree/Radians mode toggle
- Responsive layout with professional styling
